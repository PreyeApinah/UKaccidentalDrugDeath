# UK Accidental Drug Deaths

# Problem Statement 
Drug-related deaths in the UK are a major public health concern, with alarming trends indicating a growing problem. Despite efforts to mitigate this issue, the number of individuals losing their lives due to drug overdoses and related complications has been on the rise. This crisis not only impacts the affected individuals and their families but also poses a significant public health challenge. A clear understanding of the underlying causes, patterns, and demographics associated with these deaths is essential to formulate effective intervention strategies and policies that can reverse this alarming trend.


# Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to explore data on deaths classified as accidental Drug deaths in the UK in order to identify Vulnerable Populations and determine the causes and patterns  to aid formulation of intervention strategies.


# Data
The dataset was gotten from [Data.Gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-2012-2018/resource/e8f3bad9-478c-4ab4-8799-c4e996a363fd)  and it contains data for Drug related deaths from 2012-2021. 


# Methodology
The process involved  data cleaning which was done using Microsoft Excel power query. 
Since the dataset was quite large, it was imported into SQL server database to query. At the end the data results were  visualized on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ayebapreye.apinah/viz/UKAccidentalDrugDeaths/UKAccidentalDrugdeaths)
