# Data
The dataset was gotten from [Data.Gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-2012-2018/resource/e8f3bad9-478c-4ab4-8799-c4e996a363fd)  and it contains data for Drug related deaths from 2012-2021. 


# Methodology
The process involved  data cleaning which was done using Microsoft Excel power query. 
Since the dataset was quite large, it was imported into SQL server database to query. At the end the data results were  visualized on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ayebapreye.apinah/viz/UKAccidentalDrugDeaths/UKAccidentalDrugdeaths). 

# Questions

1. What is the total number of deaths due to drug-related incidents? 

2. What is the average age of these individuals?

3. Which age bracket is mostly affected? 

4. Which race has the highest number of reported deaths?

6. What is the distribution of deaths across different years?

8. Which drug caused the most deaths overall?

9. What are the residence cities with the highest number of deaths? 

10. What are the top 5 drugs involved in the reported deaths? 

11. How many deaths involved multiple drugs (polydrug toxicity) and what are the drugs?
